licenses thereof. Such intellectual property falls under § 5.1 of this License.


5: THE RIGHTS OF THE CREATOR AND FURTHER LICENSORS
 1. The Creator reserves no rights to any previously-established intellectual
    property which is implicitly or explicitly owned by any other entity or
    entities.
   a. If any such intellectual property is contained within or bundled
      alongside the Product, or is otherwise distributed with or appears

    sum of profits garnered by the Creator for creating the Product.
